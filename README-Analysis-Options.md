## Option 2: Simple Analysis with Meyda.js (Intermediate) - 2_app.js
**Requires Meyda.js library**

### Features:
- ✅ Real audio feature extraction using Meyda library
- ✅ RMS, spectral centroid, spectral rolloff analysis
- ✅ Zero-crossing rate for vocal clarity
- ✅ Automatic fallback if library not available

### Setup Required:
1. **Add Meyda script to your HTML file** (before closing `</body>` tag):
   ```html
   <script src="https://unpkg.com/meyda@5.6.2/dist/web/meyda.min.js"></script>
   <script src="app.js"></script>
   ```

2. **Copy `2_app.js` to your repo as `app.js`**

3. **Commit and deploy**

### Alternative CDN URLs:
```html
<!-- Option 1: unpkg -->
<script src="https://unpkg.com/meyda@5.6.2/dist/web/meyda.min.js"></script>

<!-- Option 2: jsDelivr -->
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/meyda@5.6.2/dist/web/meyda.min.js"></script>
```

## Option 3: Hybrid Approach (Best Balance) - 3_app.js
**No additional setup required**

### Features:
- ✅ Uses basic audio characteristics (duration, file size, quality)
- ✅ Controlled randomness biased by real audio data
- ✅ Consistent scoring for same performance
- ✅ Easy to implement and debug

### Usage:
1. Copy `3_app.js` to your repo as `app.js`  
2. Commit and push - ready to deploy!

## Recommended Testing Order:

1. **Start with Option 3** (Hybrid) - easiest to implement and debug
2. **Try Option 2** (Meyda.js) - good balance of features and complexity
3. **Upgrade to Option 1** (Full Real) - most comprehensive analysis

## Quick Deployment:

```bash
# Test Option 3 (Hybrid)
cp 3_app.js app.js
git add app.js
git commit -m "Test Option 3: Hybrid vocal analysis"
git push origin main

# Test Option 2 (Meyda.js) - Don't forget HTML script tag!
cp 2_app.js app.js
# Edit your HTML to add Meyda script
git add app.js index.html
git commit -m "Test Option 2: Meyda.js vocal analysis"  
git push origin main

# Test Option 1 (Full Real)
cp 1_app.js app.js
git add app.js
git commit -m "Test Option 1: Full real vocal analysis"
git push origin main
```

## Expected Score Improvements:

**Current (Random):**
- Same singer gets different scores each time
- No correlation with actual singing quality
- Scores: 4.2, 6.8, 5.1 (completely fake)

**Option 3 (Hybrid):**
- Scores biased by recording quality and duration
- Same performance gets similar scores
- Better singers get slightly higher scores
- Scores: 5.8, 6.2, 6.1 (more realistic)

**Option 2 (Meyda.js):**  
- Real spectral and energy analysis
- Pitch detection and stability
- Consistent scoring based on audio features
- Scores: 7.2, 7.1, 7.3 (actually based on voice)

**Option 1 (Full Real):**
- Comprehensive pitch, spectral, and temporal analysis
- Professional-grade audio feature extraction
- Most accurate assessment of vocal performance
- Scores: 6.8, 6.9, 6.7 (highly accurate and consistent)
